<!-- 
Title:
AcroQuest

Short Description:
An app that lets you learn about Acronyms.

Problem Statemnt:
To create a simple app that let's users search acronyms, see their full forms and submit their own acronyms.

Features:
Stagnant water detection, Alert Scheduling

System Flow diagram:(optional)

Technologies used + Development Process:
The App is made using React Native while the backend is made using NodeJs (Express Js). The app uses MongoDB for storing all the user data.
A user can easliy register themselves on the app. The user is then guided to a clean Home Screen where he/she can type the acronym to search in the search bar. The App then fetches all matching records from backend and displays it to the user.
The app, not only matches the entered text with the main "acronym" text of the previously stored records, but also with their full forms and descriptions so as to get better results in situations when users enters similar words instead of the exact keyword.

Challenges faced:
The main reason for working on this project was to understand the basics of hosting a project on AWS virtual machine. The procedure was difficult and hard to understand at first, but with time, I got comfortable with the AWS platform

Results 
The App provides an easy and clean interface for users to search for full forms and submit their own.
